# Hyrule Compendium

This is an app for searching through the BoTW api by the same name by [gadhagod](https://github.com/gadhagod/Hyrule-Compendium-API). It's purpose is to be a simple user interface for accessing information on all in game items. The target user is a mobile user, picking up their phone to briefly search an item while playing the game.

## Merge History

- Initial commit (Feb 18, 2023)
  Spent a few days working on this and am happy with where it currently stands! Made the Sheikah asset, due to import a few more. Not happy with overall feel from the user standpoint, but pleasantly happy with the functionality after refactoring the JS down to simpler components. Will continue refactoring as I learn more about OOP.
- Begin UI overhaul (Feb 21, 2023)
  I'm currently learning OOP and async/await, so I'm quickly realizing the issues left in my script. I was also not super happy with the quality of the UI and know I can do better. Granted, the initial stage of the project was completed in 1-2 days. I commented out the entire CSS and am beginning from the mobile site. I added 'Roboto' font which is, in italics, very similar to the in-game font. Next will be working out the details of the API -> DOM and seriously refactoring my JS.
