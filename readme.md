# Hyrule Compendium

This is an app for searching through the BoTW api by the same name by [gadhagod](https://github.com/gadhagod/Hyrule-Compendium-API). It's purpose is to be a simple user interface for accessing information on all in game items. The target user is a mobile user, picking up their phone to briefly search an item while playing the game.

## To-do

- Continue work on UI.
- Import FontAwesome and create a short function for populating hearts recovered for edible items.
- Mobile responsiveness
- Scrolling sheikah details in slate. Skeletal remains of this idea are left in CSS and HTML at the moment.
- Search functions (mistakes, related queries)
- Implement error page

## Merge History

- Initial commit (Feb 18, 2023)
  Spent a few days working on this and am happy with where it currently stands! Made the Sheikah asset, due to import a few more. Not happy with overall feel from the user standpoint, but pleasantly happy with the functionality after refactoring the JS down to simpler components. Will continue refactoring as I learn more about OOP.
